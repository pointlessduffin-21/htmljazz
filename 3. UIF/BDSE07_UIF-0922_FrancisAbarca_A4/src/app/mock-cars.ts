    {carid:1, make:"Tesla", model:"Model S", year:2022, photo:'../Images/models.png',description:"Model S is built from the ground up as an electric vehicle, with a high-strength architecture and floor-mounted battery pack for incredible occupant protection and low rollover risk. Every new Model S includes Tesla's latest active safety features, such as Automatic Emergency Braking, at no extra cost."},
    {carid:2, make:"BMW", model:"X6", year:2022, photo:'../Images/x6.png', description:"The BMW X6 is like Don Corleone, which is to say it's the godfather of coupelike SUVs. The original that debuted back in the late 2000s basically invented the controversial breed, which spawned imitators from the likes of Audi and Mercedes-Benz. While beauty is in the eye of the beholder when it comes to these polarizing crossover coupes, the sloped-back Bimmer boasts a pair of sublime engines: a 335-hp inline-six-cylinder (40i) and a 523-hp twin-turbo V-8 (M50i). Thrill seekers will want the latter, but it comes with a hefty price. Both mills are mated to an automatic transmission that's as smooth as they are. Peak performance is offered on the six-figure X6 M (reviewed separately), but even the less extreme models are entertaining to drive. The regular X5 is more upright and practical, but the 2022 BMW X6 is just as luxurious inside and better suited for extroverts."}, 
    {carid:3, make:"Mercedes-Benz", model:"G-Wagon", year:2022, photo:'../Images/gwagon.png', description:"The G-Class offers uncompromising off-road capability. There's very little that can throw it off balance. Its stability, ground clearance and robust off-road ability are legendary."}, 
    {carid:4, make:"Toyota", model:"Prius", year:2022, photo:'../Images/prius.png', description:"The 2022 Toyota Prius delivers phenomenal fuel economy and offers up a lot of passenger and cargo space, but it falls to the bottom half of the hybrid car class because of a weak powertrain and so-so interior quality."},
