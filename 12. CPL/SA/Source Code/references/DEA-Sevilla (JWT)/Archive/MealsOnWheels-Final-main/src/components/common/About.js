                            MerryMeal is a charitable organization that prepares and delivers a hot noon meal to
                            qualified adults living at home who are unable to cook for themselves or maintain their
                            nutritional status due to age, disease, or disability. Recognizing the importance of a well-balanced
                            diet and the impact it has on overall health and well-being, the organization has developed
                            several initiatives to further support its beneficiaries.
